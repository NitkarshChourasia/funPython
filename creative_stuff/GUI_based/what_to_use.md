Tell me which is the best framework, to do so.
Give me lots of other and best options available as framework for building the best python GUI based application.




There are several popular Python frameworks for building GUI applications. Some of the most commonly used ones are:

- **Tkinter**: This is the standard built-in GUI library for Python and is the most popular Python GUI framework. It's fast and easy to use, making it a great choice for building simple GUI applications.

- **PyQt**: This is a Python GUI framework that's built around the popular Qt application framework. It's a powerful and flexible framework that can be used to build complex GUI applications.

- **wxPython**: This is another popular Python GUI framework that's used to build desktop applications with graphical user interfaces. It's cross-platform and can be used to create interactive and natural user interfaces.

- **Kivy**: This is an open-source Python GUI framework that's designed for building multi-touch applications. It's cross-platform and can be used to create applications that run on multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, GNU/Linux, Windows, and macOS.

- **PySide**: This is another Python binding for the Qt application framework. It provides a set of Python modules that allow you to use Qt functionality in your Python applications.

- **PyGUI**: This is a cross-platform Python GUI framework that's designed to be lightweight and easy to use. It provides a simple API for creating GUI applications in Python.

- **PyGTK**: This is a set of Python bindings for the GTK+ graphical user interface library. It provides a way to create GUI applications that run on multiple platforms, including Linux, Windows, and macOS.

Each of these frameworks has its own strengths and weaknesses, so the best one for you will depend on your specific needs and requirements. 

If you are looking for a simple and easy-to-use framework, then **Tkinter** would be a good choice. If you need more advanced features and flexibility, then **PyQt** or **wxPython** might be better options. If you want to build multi-touch applications that run on multiple platforms, then **Kivy** would be a good choice.

I hope this helps!
