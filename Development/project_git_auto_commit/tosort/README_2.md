# Git Commit Simulator

The Git Commit Simulator is a Python script that simulates git commits for a specified number of days.

## Description

This script is useful for simulating a history of git commits. It generates a specified number of commits for each day, up to a maximum number of commits per day. The commits are then pushed to the main branch of the origin remote.

The script uses Python's built-in `os` module to execute git commands, and the `random` module to generate a random number of commits per day. It also includes error handling and logging to make it robust and easy to debug.
