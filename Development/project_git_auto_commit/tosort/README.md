# <p align=center>Git Auto Commit <p>

Commit to repo every day for the perfect commit streak

## Requirments

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Setup

1. Setup a new repository. (Why?)(Click here)
2. Have it in your local machine.
3. Have your git properly configured with your GitHub account.
4. Sync the repository (git pull & git push)

## WHY?!

Only because I wanted to. I hate to see my git commit stats have gaps, and so I made this SUPER simple script to create a commit to this repository to bring up my commit streak :P, and to fill in the gaps where I don't commit on one day. Again this is just a silly project and has no purpose besides to 'cure my ocd' for a perfect commit streak :D. I hope if you have the same issue this script will help.
