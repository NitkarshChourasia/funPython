/*
https://leetcode.com/problems/image-smoother/
Given a 2D integer matrix M representing the gray scale of an image, you need to design a smoother to make the gray
scale of each cell becomes the average gray scale (rounding down) of all the 8 surrounding cells and itself. If a cell
has less than 8 surrounding cells, then use as many as you can.

Iterate over cells of image. For each cell count neighbours and sum their values. Set smoothed pixel to sum / count.
Time - O(mn)
Space - O(mn)
