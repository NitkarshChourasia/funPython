https://leetcode.com/problems/moving-average-from-data-stream/
Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.

Add the numbers to an array of size k with a pointer to indicate the next index to be replaced.
Track the sum and count.
Time - O(k) for constructor, O(1) for next()
Space - O(k)
