/*
https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-permutation/
Given a string, determine if a permutation of the string could form a palindrome.

Add each character to a set.  If caharcter is seen twice then remove it from set.  Set contains all chars with and
odd count.  Palindrome can have at most one such char.
Time - O(n)
Space - O(n)
