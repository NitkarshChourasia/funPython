Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not.
However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.
Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a
number n, return if n new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

Iterate over flowerbed, moving forward to the next potentially free space if there is a flower in a cell or and
adjacent cells. Wehne flower can be planted, decrement count still to plant and test if count is zero.
Time - O(n)
Space - O(1)
