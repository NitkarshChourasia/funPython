You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two
characters: + and -, you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--".
The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.
Write a function to compute all possible states of the string after one valid move.

Check for consecutive pair of '+' chars.
Time - O(n**2)
Space - O(n**2)
