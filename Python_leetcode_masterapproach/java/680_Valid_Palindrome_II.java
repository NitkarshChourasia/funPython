/*
https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome-ii/
Given a non-empty string s, you may delete at most one character. Judge whether you can make it a palindrome.

Set left and right indices to the ends of s. Iterate inwards. If characters do not match, either left or right must be
deleted so continue searching for a palindrome with no more deletions allowed.
Time - O(n)
Space - O(1)

        while (left < right) {
            if (s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right)) {
