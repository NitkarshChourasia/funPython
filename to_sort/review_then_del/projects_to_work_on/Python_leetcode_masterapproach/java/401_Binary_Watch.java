https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-watch/
A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11), and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59).
Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.
Given a non-negative integer n which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on, return all possible times the watch could represent.

Enumerate all times (12 * 60 = 720 possibilities) and count number of with bits set equal to num.
Alternatively, precompute bits set for all times and look up.
Time - O(1) since finite number of times.
Space - O(1)
