```
To create a pre-commit hook for a repository exclusively for Python-based programming language programs and projects, you can follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the root directory of your Python repository.

2. Inside the root directory, create a new directory named `.git/hooks` if it doesn't already exist.

3. Inside the `.git/hooks` directory, create a new file named `pre-commit` without any file extension. This will be the script that runs before each commit.

4. Open the `pre-commit` file with a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).

5. Write your pre-commit script in Python. 
Here's an example of a simple pre-commit script for running linting and
 formatting checks using popular Python tools `flake8` and `black`:

python

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import subprocess
import sys

def run_command(command):
    try:
        subprocess.run(command, check=True, shell=True)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
        sys.exit(1)

def main():
    # Run linting checks using flake8
    run_command("flake8 .")

    # Run code formatting checks using black
    run_command("black --check .")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    
    
```    


6. Save the file and make sure it is executable. On Unix-based systems, you can use the following command to give execute permission:

bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit


7. Once the pre-commit hook is in place, every time you make a commit, 
the script will automatically run the specified checks. 
If any of the checks fail, 
the commit will be prevented until the issues are fixed.

Remember to customize the pre-commit script according to the specific requirements of your repository 
and the checks you want to enforce. You can include additional checks such as unit tests, 
documentation checks, or any other coding standards you follow in your projects.
