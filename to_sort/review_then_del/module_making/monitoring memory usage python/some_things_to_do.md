Sure! To make the code importable as a module for tracing memory in other programs, we can refactor it into a function that returns the memory usage information. Here's the modified version of the code as an importable module:

Create a new Python file named `memory_tracer.py`:

```python
import tracemalloc

def format_memory(memory_bytes):
    if memory_bytes < 1024:
        return f"{memory_bytes} bytes"
    elif memory_bytes < 1024 * 1024:
        return f"{memory_bytes / 1024:.2f} KB"
    else:
        return f"{memory_bytes / (1024 * 1024):.2f} MB"

def trace_memory_usage(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        tracemalloc.start()

        result = func(*args, **kwargs)

        current_memory, peak_memory = tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()

        print("Current memory usage:", format_memory(current_memory))
        print("Peak memory usage:", format_memory(peak_memory))

        tracemalloc.stop()

        return result

    return wrapper
```

Now, you can use this `memory_tracer` module to trace memory usage in other programs by importing and using the `trace_memory_usage` decorator. Here's an example of how to use it in another Python script:

```python
from memory_tracer import trace_memory_usage

@trace_memory_usage
def app():
    lt = [i for i in range(100000)]

def main():
    app()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this example, the `trace_memory_usage` decorator is applied to the `app()` function, which will enable memory tracing for that function when it's called. The `memory_tracer` module takes care of starting and stopping memory tracing and printing the memory usage information.
