What lessons toxic relationship taught me!

Introduction:
It was summers of 2022. I met a girl. She appeared sweet, cute and simple. I was still in university, she was working in a good corporate position. Probably maybe a couple years older then me. It started soon, we got tangled into each other pretty quick. I was childish, I would say. I didn't knew how to be in a relationship with a girl. As, it was my first relationship, a romantic one I would say. I had good best girl friends, but a romantic relationship, nah…, 
When it started I was escatic, literally on the 11th clouds.
But, when the honeymoon phase ended. She started to able to see the actuality out of the jacked up on loveroid (love + steroid of love) reality. When her blurry reason got cleared. That's when the GREAT DRAMA unfolds.
Give every subpoint a deserving title.
Thus, this is what my first failing relationship taught me.

There is nothing as equal love - One of you will love the another more, for sure.
Never believe words, but actions - Instead of saying I love you/too, frequently it is better to show and vice - versa. Believe only what you see through actions.
Because, Actions speaks louder then words.
If their is genuine feelings you won't have to chase, you both will run towards each other that is will be attracted with the speed of light to each other just like two trains coming to each other in adjacent tracks but here the tracks will be the same. The Unity of Souls.
(seems like a nice name for my new game: The Unity of Souls)
Sometimes what kills a relationship is lack of proper communication.
How?

Sometimes misunderstanding happens!

How?
Because we live in a delusional half baked reality made up by our minds.
Sometimes, just by the half of the incident we make up our mind and start to believe that the other person is wrong. But, in reality it is not the case. We just need to communicate properly and understand the other person's perspective.
